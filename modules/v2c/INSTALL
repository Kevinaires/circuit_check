INSTALLATION NOTES

There should be no problems in setting the whole thing up: you shouldn't ever
need Yacc nor Lex since the generated c sources are provided.

Just type 'make' and hope.

MORE DETAILED INSTALLATION NOTES

1. Edit 'makefile' to match your operating system.
   By default it is configured to work under UNIX (not SUN_OS).

2. Edit the defs.h file to match your needs.

3. Run make.

4. Ignore warnings like `offset -1 in address` or `declared but not used`

5. If you get errors like `don't know how to make xxx.x` run make again.

==> You should end up with v2c and v2cx.
