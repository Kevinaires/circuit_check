                      V2C 1.12 - VHDL to C translator
                      -------------------------------

                    Copyright (c) 1995, Cristian Ghezzi



These are the sources of v2c and v2cx, two programs that try to translate a
VHDL source into a C function.

This is the first public release: no documentation (have a look at my www
pages), clumsy code, few comments, bugs (?) ...
No improvements are planned, so be happy with it; only a large and
enthusiastic response could make things change.

In the examples directory you can find (imagine what...) some examples of
input and output files.

See the install file to build the binaries.
